 Converting CFGs to Chomsky Normal Form

A context-free grammar is in Chomsky Normal form if every production is of the form 
A → BC
A → a
Where a denotes a terminal and A, B, C denote variables where neither B nor C is the start variable.
In addition, there is a production
S → ε
if and only if ε belongs to the language.
